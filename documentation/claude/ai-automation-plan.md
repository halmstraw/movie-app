# AI Automation Plan for Movie App Development

This document outlines how we'll leverage AI tools (particularly Claude 3.7 in Cursor IDE) to automate various aspects of the application development process.

## 1. Code Generation Automation

### Component Generation
We'll create a system where Claude can generate React components based on simple descriptions:

```
# Example prompt for Cursor IDE
Generate a MovieCard component that displays:
- Movie poster
- Title
- Release year
- Rating
- "Add to favorites" button
- Should handle loading states
- Should be responsive
```

### API Integration
Claude can automate the creation of API integration code:

```
# Example prompt for Cursor IDE
Create API hooks for:
- Fetching movie details by ID
- Searching movies by title
- Getting popular movies
Use the movieApi service we already defined
```

## 2. Test Automation

We'll use Claude to generate comprehensive test suites:

```
# Example prompt for Cursor IDE
Write unit tests for the FavoritesContext with jest and react-testing-library
Cover all methods: addFavorite, removeFavorite, and isFavorite
Include both success and edge cases
```

## 3. Documentation Automation

Claude can maintain project documentation:

```
# Example prompt for Cursor IDE
Update the README.md with:
- Project overview
- Installation instructions
- Usage examples
- API documentation
- Available scripts
```

## 4. Code Review Automation

We'll create a workflow where Claude reviews code changes:

```
# Example prompt for Cursor IDE
Review the following code changes:
[paste diff or code here]
Check for:
- Potential bugs
- Performance issues
- Best practices adherence
- Accessibility concerns
```

## 5. Feature Development Pipeline

For new features, we'll establish this workflow:

1. **Specification**: Describe feature requirements in natural language
2. **Planning**: Claude breaks down the implementation into tasks
3. **Implementation**: Claude generates code for each task
4. **Testing**: Claude creates tests for the new feature
5. **Documentation**: Claude updates documentation to include the new feature

## 6. Setup Automation Scripts

We'll create scripts that Claude can execute to automate repetitive tasks:

```javascript
// scripts/generate-component.js
// Script that takes a component description and generates boilerplate
```

## 7. Continuous Learning Loop

We'll implement a feedback system where:

1. Human developers review AI-generated code
2. Feedback is documented for Claude to learn from
3. Patterns and preferences are captured in a "team standards" document
4. Claude references this document in future code generation

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Basic Automation Setup
- Set up GitHub repository
- Create initial project structure
- Implement basic components manually
- Document coding patterns and preferences

### Phase 2: AI-Assisted Development
- Use Claude to generate remaining components
- Implement API integration with Claude's assistance
- Create tests with Claude

### Phase 3: Advanced Automation
- Create custom scripts for repetitive tasks
- Implement code review automation
- Develop documentation generation workflows

### Phase 4: Mobile Extension
- Use Claude to help transform web components to React Native
- Automate the creation of platform-specific code
- Generate tests for mobile-specific functionality
