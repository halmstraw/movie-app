# GitHub Repository Setup

## Creating the Repository

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and sign in to your account
2. Click on the "+" icon in the top-right corner and select "New repository"
3. Enter repository details:
   - Repository name: `ai-movie-app` (or your preferred name)
   - Description: "A movie application built with React and automated with AI"
   - Visibility: Public (or Private if you prefer)
   - Initialize with a README
   - Add a .gitignore template for React
   - Choose a license (MIT recommended for open-source projects)
4. Click "Create repository"

## Setting Up Local Development

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/ai-movie-app.git
cd ai-movie-app

# Set up the React project
npx create-react-app .

# Install essential dependencies
npm install react-router-dom axios styled-components

# Initialize Git and make initial commit
git add .
git commit -m "Initial project setup with Create React App"
git push origin main
```

## GitHub Workflow for CI/CD

Create a file at `.github/workflows/main.yml` with the following content:

```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build-and-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    
    - name: Set up Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      with:
        node-version: 18
        
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm ci
      
    - name: Run linting
      run: npm run lint || echo "Linting not configured yet"
      
    - name: Run tests
      run: npm test -- --passWithNoTests
      
    - name: Build
      run: npm run build
```

This basic CI/CD pipeline will run linting, tests, and build your project on every push to main and on every pull request.
