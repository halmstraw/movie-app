# Project Summary for Claude

## Project Overview
- Creating a movie application where users can search for TV shows/films and add them to favorites
- Initial focus on web browser implementation, with plans to extend to native iOS/Android apps
- Primary goal: Learn how to automate development with AI agents
- Secondary goal: Create a functional movie application

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React (web) / React Native (mobile)
- Selected for cross-platform capabilities and strong ecosystem
- Will enable code sharing between web and mobile implementations
- Using TMDB API for movie data

## Development Environment
- GitHub for version control and repository hosting
- Cursor IDE with Claude 3.7 integration for AI-assisted development
- CI/CD workflows through GitHub Actions

## Project Structure
- Organized by feature and responsibility
- Clear separation between components, API layer, and application logic
- Context API for state management (especially favorites functionality)
- Responsive design for cross-device compatibility

## AI Automation Implementation
- Created comprehensive automation plan covering:
  - Code generation for components and API integration
  - Test automation
  - Documentation maintenance
  - Code review processes
  - Feature development pipelines
- Four-phase implementation strategy from basic to advanced automation

## Current Status
- Repository setup instructions provided
- Project structure defined
- Initial API integration code created
- Favorites functionality implementation ready
- AI automation plan detailed

## Next Steps
- Execute repository setup
- Implement core components starting with movie search and display
- Build favorites functionality using the provided context
- Start using AI automation for component generation

This summary will be updated as the project progresses to maintain context continuity between different Claude instances.
